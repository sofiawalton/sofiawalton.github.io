            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>
              I used Microsoft Co-Pilot to help me debug my code when I was trying to understand the functionality of the SW (pin) on the joystick.
              Everytime I included code that had an else statement for the joystick's position when there would be no shapes, it didn't work. Microsoft Co-Pilot was unable
              to help me understand why that was happening, so I ended up just removing that part of the code entirely and it worked. I would've liked to figure out 
              how to make the joystick be at a resting state, but instead, my joystick starts in the square shape with the red LED on. I also used Co-Pilot to help me 
              understand how to read serial commands from p5.js to the Arduino, which I was struggling with at first.
