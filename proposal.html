        <h2>Project Concept/Motivation</h2>
            <p>“I want to build a coaster/cup accessory or attachment  that mesures the temperature of the cup/mug and once 
                it senses the “perfect sipping temperature” it lights up an RGB LED to notify the user that their drink is ready to sip on.”</p>

            <h2>Anticipated Bill of Materials</h2>
                 <ul>
                    <li>RGB LED strip (for notifying when the temp is ready for sipping!)</li>
                    <li>Thermistor (for temp sensing)</li>
                    <li>Resistor (to create voltage divider with thermistor)</li>
                    <li>Transistor (for swtiching the LED strip)</li>
                    <li>12V power supply (for powering LEDs)</li>
                    <li>9V battery (for powering arduino)</li>
                    <li>3D printed coaster/cup attachment </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Timeline & Contingency Plans</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1: Research temperature ranges for ideal beverage sipping and prototype a thermistor circuit on my breadboard.</li>
                    <li>2: Integrate LEDs and calibrate temperature thresholds.</li>
                    <li>3: Pototype a cardboard version of the coaster while thinking about: the thermisistor placement & hiding other components (breadboard/arduino)</li>
                    <li>4: Final iterations on coaster design & CAD integration. Begin 3D printing coaster.</li>
                    <li>5: Assemble the final prototype and make adjustments based on testing.</li>
                    <li>Contingency Plans: If I run into issues with the thermistor accuracy, I will explore using a different type of temperature sensor such as a digital temperature sensor. 
                        If power supply for the LED strip becomes an issue, I will consider using a lower power LED solution or reducing the number of LEDs used.</li>
