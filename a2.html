          <p>
            This is my 'Blink' circuit. The breadboard is connected to the Arduino with:
        <ul>
          <li>Green wire → pin 8</li>
          <li>Red wire → pin 13</li>
          <li>Yellow wire → pin 4</li>
          <li>Black wire → GND</li>
        </ul>
        Resistors and LEDs are placed next to the associated wires.

            <h2>Questions</h2>

            <h3>1. Voltage x Time Graph</h3>
            <img src="graph.jpeg" class="blink1.jpeg" />
            <p>
              I chose the blink times (500ms, 700ms, 400ms) randomly while writing the code.
              The graph shows the high (on) and low (off) times for each LED over a 3200ms cycle
              (1000ms green + 1400ms red + 800ms yellow).
            </p>

            <h3>2. Max Current</h3>
            <p>
              If powered by a 1200 mAh battery, it would take approximately 60 hours to drain the battery when running this circuit, assuming each LED draws about 20mA when lit and they are not all on at the same time.
            </p>

              <h3>3. Voltage</h3>
            <p> 
              When measuring the voltage of my red LED, I got 2.03V. This is because red LEDs typically have a forward voltage of around 2.0V, which is the voltage drop across the LED when it is lit. This compares to the theoretical voltage of 2.0V for red LEDs, indicating that my measurement is accurate and consistent with expected values.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Help Used</h3>
            <p>
              None
